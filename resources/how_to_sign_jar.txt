After he crossstitch.jar is created from packager.jardesc, it must be 
signed. For signing, the keytool/jarsigner combination of tools that 
come withe SDK is sufficient. 

Create a key in the keystore (or use one you already have). You'll be 
prompted for information like first name and last. You should at least 
fill in that information.

keytool -genkey -keystore myKeys -alias thaidev

Sign the JAR. Be sure to remember your password from the previous step.

jarsigner -keystore myKeys crossstitch.jar thaidev
